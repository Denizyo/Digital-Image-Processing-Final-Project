# Digital-Image-Processing-Final-Project
Final project for digital image processing course. 
My objective was to find and classify different sizes of gold nanoparticles in a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) image. For this project, I have used Python 3.6, scikit-image, opencv and SciPy â€“ Ndimage libraries.
Steps:
-Image Editing
-Increasing the sharpness using Fast Fourier Transform
-Inverting the Image & Removing background
-Otsu Thresholding
-Filters
-Increasing the contrast
-Gamma Correction
-Sauvola Thresholding
-Segmentation
